# Welcome

I'm Thomas Gollenia and I work as a coder and a theologian at a [childrens missionary fellowship](https://kids-team.at). 
I mainly develop plugins and themes for Wordpress, including ES6/React/JSX-Stuff. I love Italian coffe and italian food (which I cook by myself). I live in the mountains, so
climbing, hiking and cross country skiing is what keeps me in balance. I believe in Jesus Christ as my saviour and I believe in the Bible as Gods word.


### Coding experience

I started coding in the 90ies, mainly playing with QBasic and a little C. I guess, copying code from books from the public library and being frustrated because it didn't work, was not only my experience. I went through Typo3, Silverstripe and some other CMS, however most customers want to have a Wordpress site. So I became a Wordpress Programmer. My main coding languages are PHP, JavaScript and I do a little bit of C and Go. I'm also intrested in home automation, console programming and generally trying out new languages and libraries. I don't like Java and Python though of no good reason.
