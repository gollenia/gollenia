# Welcome

I'm Thomas Gollenia and I work as a coder and a theologian at a [childrens missionary fellowship](https://kids-team.at). 
I mainly develop plugins and themes for Wordpress, including ES6/React/JSX-Stuff. I love Italian coffe and italian food (which I cook by myself). I live in the mountains, so
climbing, hiking and cross country skiing is what keeps me in balance. I believe in Jesus Christ as my saviour and in the bible as Gods word.


### Coding experience

My main coding languages are PHP, JavaScript and I do a little bit of C and Go. I'm also intrested in home automation, console programming and generally trying out new languages and libraries. I don't like Java and Python though of no good reason.
